A complication, however, arises from the fact that each subcell has to generate the same electric current in the case of the conventional two-terminal devices. Prominent examples of these tandem or multijunction solar cells are the a-Si/SiGe and the GaInP/GaAs/Ge technologies, the latter being used in space applications. For terrestrial systems the development of an optical concentrator technology is an attractive option with the potential for very low electricity generation cost [11]. Here the required direct sunlight is focussed onto a small-sized solar cell. In a system that concentrates the sunlight by a factor 100– 10 </p>
